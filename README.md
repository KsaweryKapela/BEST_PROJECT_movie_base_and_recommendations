# BEST_PROJECT_movie_base_and_recommendations
Website that uses huge scrapped database. Helps organize preferences, allows to explore new movies, comes with advanced algorythm that gives personalized recommnedations.

Project is almost done except authorization (which is half-done), loading bars and mobile page/better responsivness. Probably not gonna be finishing it anytime soon since I'm satisfied with what I have now and don't want to waste more time in Flask and Vanilla JS.

Moving on to learn Django and React now.
