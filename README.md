# Movie_Base_And_Recommendations
Website that uses huge scrapped database. Helps organize preferences, allows to explore new movies, comes with advanced algorythm that gives personalized recommnedations.

Project is almost done except authorization (which is half-done), loading bars and mobile page/better responsivness.
Some code would also definitly use some refractoring.

Probably not gonna be finishing this project anytime soon since I'm satisfied with what I have now and don't want to waste more time in Flask and Vanilla JS.

Moving on to learn Django and React and do different projects with them.
